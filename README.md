## Sentiment-Analysis-in-Mexico-s-Magical-Towns---MeIA2025

## üßæ About This Challenge

This project is part of MeIA 2025 (Macroentrenamiento en Inteligencia Artificial), an academic initiative organized by the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM). MeIA is focused on intensive training in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is designed to support students from Latin America and the Caribbean in solving real-world challenges using AI, with a strong emphasis on practical application.

## Project Description

Tourism is a vital social, cultural, and economic activity. In countries like **Mexico**, **Cuba**, and **Colombia**, it represents a key source of income and employment. For instance, tourism accounts for **8.7% of Mexico's GDP**, generating more than **4.5 million direct jobs**.

In this project, we apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze and classify real tourist reviews collected from TripAdvisor, focusing on iconic destinations such as:

- üá≤üáΩ **Guanajuato and Riviera Nayarit (Mexico)**
- üá®üá∫ **Cuba**
- üá®üá¥ **Colombia**

## Challenge Goal

The main goal of this challenge is to build a multiclass classification model that can automatically understand and label tourist reviews written in Spanish. The model must classify each review according to three key aspects, applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify over 5,000 reviews about Mexico‚Äôs Magical Towns, with the aim of improving tourism.

**Sentiment Polarity** (rating-like score):
   - Reviews are categorized on a **1 to 5 stars** scale, where:
     - ‚≠ê 1: Very Negative
     - ‚≠ê‚≠ê 2: Negative
     - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 3: Neutral
     - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 4: Positive
     - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 5: Very Positive 

## Dataset

Two Excel files were provided for the challenge:

- `MeIA_2025_train.xlsx`: Contains 5,000 labeled reviews for training.
- `MeIA_2025_test.xlsx`: Contains 2,500 unlabeled reviews for test.

Each review includes the text, along with metadata such as town, region, type, and sentiment label (for training).

## Why This Matters

This project aims to:

- Promote AI solutions focused on the **Spanish language**.
- Offer practical tools for the **tourism industry** in Latin America.
- Strengthen skills in **NLP, deep learning**, and **multiclass classification**
